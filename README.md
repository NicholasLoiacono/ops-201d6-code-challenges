#### Script: Ops 201d6 Class 14 Ops Challenge Markdown File
#### Author: Nicholas Loiacono
#### Date: 02/23/2023
#### Purpose: To summarize what my Ops 201 repo is all about.


### What is this repo all about?
* This repo is a collection of all coding challenges that I researched and performed while in my Ops 201 course in Code Fellows. It can be referenced for a multitude of necessary tasks to be performed along with out-of-the-box thinking for things that I may just want to use in the future.
### Why are you learning these skills?
* These skills are going to help me in future employment while working in a wide variety of possible roles.
### What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?
* I learned mainly how to create variables, arrays, functions, and scripts. I continued to learn how to to call a function to action along with put scripting and variables inside of a function. I learned how to perform tasks in Terminal and in Powershell, so I can now distinguish between how difficult it is to learn one and then switch to the other.
### What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?
* I would have to choose Ops Challenge Class 05, because it was when I first started to realize how I could create customized code. I was able to put my results into a nice kind of table when the outcome was printed in the terminal.
### How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?
* I found that shell scripting gives you a better sense of control when setting up workplace computers. The later Ops Challenges I was performing were focused around automating specific commands to happen on the computers that would generally be beneficial if automated to run on workplace computers. When having a multitude of computers, the automation of the shell scripting could save countless man hours.
### What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?
* I would like to improve greatly on Powershell scripting. I find it much more complicated and difficult to perform the Powershell scripting, so I would devote a great deal of time to learning more about it and how to perform commands properly without causing any harm.
### What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?
* I think that I could improve in all areas of my shell scripting. I am new to code and it is the most difficult aspect of my cybersecurity learning journey; so I could use a lot of dedicated time and research on how to perform certain aspects of code, certain styles of code, and how to clean it up so I do not have longer code than I need (even though it gets the job done).
